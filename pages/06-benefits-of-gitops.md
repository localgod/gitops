# The Real Benefits (And Trade-offs)

<div>

**Why I Love GitOps:**
- **Auditability:** Every change in Git history. Compliance audits become trivial.
- **Rollback:** Git revert is your panic button. Works every time.
- **Developer Experience:** Developers use Git, not kubectl. Lower barrier.
- **Security:** Git RBAC = deployment RBAC. No cluster credentials on laptops.
- **Consistency:** Dev, staging, prodâ€”all defined the same way.

**The Honest Downsides:**
- **Git Discipline Required:** Bad commits = bad deploys. No shortcuts.
- **Learning Curve:** Teams need to understand declarative thinking.
- **Tooling Complexity:** Setting up Argo CD or Flux isn't trivial. Secrets management is hard.
- **Imperative Workflows:** Sometimes you need a one-off command. GitOps fights you.

*Is it worth it? For production systems, absolutely. For quick prototypes? Maybe overkill.*
