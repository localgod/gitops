# Our Journey Through CI/CD and IaC Tools
 
**CruiseControl** – Released: 2001 | Our adoption: 2006  
*The OG of continuous integration. Primitive by today's standards, but back then it felt like magic—automating builds instead of babysitting them.*

**Jenkins** – Released: 2011 (fork of Hudson)  
*An evolution of CruiseControl with plugins galore and a thriving community. We jumped on early—because who doesn't love a CI tool that feels like LEGO for automation?*

**Travis CI** – Released: 2011 | Our adoption: 2011  
*Game-changer for personal projects. Ephemeral build agents? Yes, please! Travis made CI feel lightweight and modern—until it didn't.*

**GitHub Actions** – Announced: 2018 | Our adoption: Public Beta  
*Replaced Travis CI for us. Why? Because GitHub baked CI/CD right into the repo. No more juggling third-party integrations—just purer workflow integration.*
