# The Real Benefits (And Trade-offs)

**The Good:**
- **Auditability:** Every change in Git history. Compliance audits become trivial.
- **Rollback:** Git revert is your panic button.
- **Developer Experience:** Developers use Git anyway.
- **Access Control:** Git RBAC controls who can deploy.
- **Consistency:** Dev, staging, prod—all defined the same way.

**The Bad:**
- **Git Discipline Required:** Bad commits = bad deploys
- **Learning Curve:** Teams need to understand declarative thinking.
- **Tooling Complexity:** Setting up GitOps tools isn't trivial.
- **Imperative Workflows:** Sometimes you just want to mess with production. GitOps fights you.
