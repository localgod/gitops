# Migrating to GitOps

**Start small, expand gradually:**

- **Proof of Concept** – One non-critical app in dev/staging with Argo CD + Terraform
- **Expand Scope** – Add more apps, establish patterns, train team
- **Production Rollout** – Start with low-risk workloads, run parallel initially
- **Optimize** – Refine structure, improve based on feedback

*Don't migrate everything at once. Learn as you go.*
