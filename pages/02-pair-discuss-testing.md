# Quick Pair Discussion: Testing Microservices - 2 minutes

Please turn to the person next to you and take 2 minutes to discuss:

- How do you test integrations reliably when individual microservices are changing?
- What strategies or tooling do you use for contract, integration, or end-to-end tests?
- Where do you see gaps or recurring flakiness in your test pipelines?

We'll collect a few short answers after the timer.

<!-- Optional speaker note: Start a 2-minute timer, then ask for 2 quick volunteers to share one approach they use. -->
