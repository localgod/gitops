# What We've Learned About GitOps

<div class="text-left mt-4 text-sm">


- GitOps is **declarative and Git-driven**—if it's not in Git, it doesn't exist in production.

- It solves **real problems**: configuration drift, audit nightmares, and fragile deployments that keep you up at night.

- Unlike traditional CI/CD, GitOps uses **pull-based reconciliation**. The cluster pulls from Git, not the other way around.

- Adoption requires **cultural shifts** (trust Git, stop manual changes) and **tooling investment** (GitOps controllers, configuration management).

- **Is it worth it?** For production systems with compliance needs and multiple environments—absolutely. For quick prototypes—probably overkill.

*After years of CI/CD evolution, GitOps feels like the natural next step. It's not perfect, but it's the best approach we've found for managing modern infrastructure.*
