# My Journey Through CI/CD and IaC Tools

**CruiseControl** – Released: 2001 | My adoption: 2006  
*The OG of continuous integration. Primitive by today's standards, but back then it felt like magic—automating builds instead of babysitting them.*

<v-click>

**Jenkins** – Released: 2011 (fork of Hudson)  
*An evolution of CruiseControl with plugins galore and a thriving community. I jumped on early—because who doesn't love a CI tool that feels like LEGO for automation?*

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Travis CI** – Released: 2011 | My adoption: 2011  
*Game-changer for personal projects. Ephemeral build agents? Yes, please! Travis made CI feel lightweight and modern—until it didn't.*

</v-click>

<v-click>

**GitHub Actions** – Announced: 2018 | My adoption: Public Beta  
*Replaced Travis CI for me. Why? Because GitHub baked CI/CD right into the repo. No more juggling third-party integrations—just pure workflow bliss.*

# My Journey Through CI/CD and IaC Tools

<div class="text-xs backdrop-blur-sm bg-black/60 p-4 rounded-lg">

**Chef** – Released: 2009 | My adoption: 2013  
*At first, I thought: "Do I really need this?" Turns out, yes—especially when infrastructure started feeling more like code than hardware.*

<v-click>

**Puppet** – Released: 2005 | My adoption: 2018  
*Late to the party, but discovering declarative over imperative was like switching from manual driving to autopilot. Why fight the system when you can declare your intent?*

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Terraform** – Released: 2014 | My adoption: 2019  
*By then, managing physical servers had lost its charm. Terraform felt like the grown-up way to handle cloud resources—declarative, predictable, and scalable.*

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Ansible** – Released: 2012 | My adoption: 2019  
*Complemented Terraform nicely for configuration management. Terraform for infrastructure, Ansible for the rest. Each tool has its place.*

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Argo CD** – Released: 2018  
*Recently caught my eye as Kubernetes became the default hosting playground. Pairs well with Terraform—Argo CD for apps, Terraform for infrastructure. GitOps for everything.*

Eeach tool taught me something valuable about automation, declarative systems, and the benefits of treating infrastructure as code.
