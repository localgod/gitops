# GitOps vs Traditional CI/CD

**How I Used to Deploy vs How I Deploy Now:**

| Aspect | Traditional CI/CD | GitOps | Reality Check |
|--------|-------------------|--------|---------------|
| **Trigger** | Push-based | Pull-based | *No deploy anxiety* |
| **Source of Truth** | Pipeline scripts | Git repository | *One place to look* |
| **Deployment Logic** | In pipeline scripts | External controller | *Build vs deploy separation* |
| **Rollback** | Manual or scripted | Git revert | *Just another commit* |
| **Observability** | Pipeline-centric | State-centric | *Know what's running* |

**The Big Shift:** GitOps decouples deployment logic from CI pipelines. Your CI builds and tests. Your GitOps controller deploys and maintains. Separation of concerns at its finest.
