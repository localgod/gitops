# The Problems GitOps Actually Solves

**Real Operational Pain Points:**

| Challenge                                | GitOps Solution                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual configuration drift               | Continuous reconciliation from Git                         |
| Lack of audit trails                     | Git history provides full traceability                     |
| Fragile deployments                      | Declarative, version-controlled deployments                |
| Environment inconsistencies              | Git-based environment definitions                          |
| Complex rollback procedures              | Git revert = environment rollback                          |
| Combinatorial explosion of microservices | Testing environments can be branches of configuration repo |

**The Thermostat Analogy:** GitOps is like a thermostat—you set the desired temperature (Git), and the system continuously adjusts to maintain it (runtime reconciliation). No manual intervention needed.
