# My Journey Through CI/CD and IaC Tools

<div class="text-xs backdrop-blur-sm bg-black/60 p-4 rounded-lg">

**Chef** – Released: 2009 | My adoption: 2013  
*At first, I thought: "Do I really need this?" Turns out, yes—especially when infrastructure started feeling more like code than hardware.*

**Puppet** – Released: 2005 | My adoption: 2018  
*Late to the party, but discovering declarative over imperative was like switching from manual driving to autopilot. Why fight the system when you can declare your intent?*

**Terraform** – Released: 2014 | My adoption: 2019  
*By then, managing physical servers had lost its charm. Terraform felt like the grown-up way to handle cloud resources—declarative, predictable, and scalable.*

**Ansible** – Released: 2012 | My adoption: 2019  
*Complemented Terraform nicely for configuration management. Terraform for infrastructure, Ansible for the rest. Each tool has its place.*

**Argo CD** – Released: 2018  
*Recently caught my eye as Kubernetes became the default hosting playground. Pairs well with Terraform—Argo CD for apps, Terraform for infrastructure. GitOps for everything.*
