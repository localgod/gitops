# Problem GitOps Solves

**Operational Challenges Addressed:**

| Challenge | GitOps Solution |
|----------|------------------|
| Manual configuration drift | Continuous reconciliation from Git |
| Lack of audit trails | Git history provides full traceability |
| Fragile deployments | Declarative, version-controlled deployments |
| Environment inconsistencies | Git-based environment definitions |
| Complex rollback procedures | Git revert = environment rollback |

**Analogy:**

Think of GitOps as a **thermostat**: You set the desired temperature (Git), and the system continuously adjusts to maintain it (runtime reconciliation).
