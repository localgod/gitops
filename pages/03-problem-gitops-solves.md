# The Problems GitOps Actually Solves

**Real Operational Pain Points:**

| Challenge | GitOps Solution | My Take |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Manual configuration drift | Continuous reconciliation from Git | *No more "it works on my machine"* |
| Lack of audit trails | Git history provides full traceability | *Git blame for compliance* |
| Fragile deployments | Declarative, version-controlled deployments | *Deployments become boring (good!)* |
| Environment inconsistencies | Git-based environment definitions | *Dev, staging, prod—same repo* |
| Complex rollback procedures | Git revert = environment rollback | *Panic rollback? Just revert* |

**The Thermostat Analogy:** GitOps is like a thermostat—you set the desired temperature (Git), and the system continuously adjusts to maintain it (runtime reconciliation). No manual intervention needed.
